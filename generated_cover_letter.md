Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name of Hiring Manager, or "Hiring Team"],

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Mechanical Design Engineer position at [Company Name], as advertised on [Platform where you saw the advertisement]. With a strong foundation in product design, optimization, and development, coupled with hands-on experience in CAD software and a passion for creating innovative solutions, I am confident in my ability to contribute significantly to your team developing automated heavy equipment.

Throughout my tenure as a Jr. Mechanical Engineer at Miko.ai, I have gained extensive experience in the end-to-end design process, from concept ideation and surface modeling to the development of jigs and fixtures for mass production. My work on product display units, LED integration, and mechanism design, including camera shutters and head movement, demonstrates my capability to handle complex mechanical challenges and integrate them into functional prototypes. I am particularly adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, including electronics and robotics, to achieve design objectives and improve design efficiency.

The job description highlights the need for expertise in CAD software, design-for-manufacturing (DFMA), and a proven track record of delivering complex systems from concept to production. My proficiency in SolidWorks, Creo, and Fusion 360, along with my experience in DFMA principles, directly aligns with these requirements. I am eager to leverage my skills in developing robust and reliable automation systems that remove humans from hazardous tasks.

I am particularly drawn to [Company Name]'s mission of developing automated mobile heavy equipment. My project experience, such as the "Automatic Floor & Wall Cleaning Machine," showcases my ability to conceptualize and develop products that reduce human effort and improve efficiency in large-scale environments. I am eager to apply my design skills to your innovative projects and contribute to pushing the boundaries of automation.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your team.

Sincerely,
Kaustubh Narvekar
